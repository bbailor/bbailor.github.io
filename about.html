                    <li>By the time I was a senior I had a decent season and talked to coaches here at Quinnipiac</li>
                    <li>I visited the campus and ultimately decided to commit here.</li>
                    <li>I had to sit out my first college cross country season due to medical reasons, but have been
                        having a very fun and successful track season so far!
